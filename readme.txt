This repo contains the code I used to produce results for my masters project
at Imperial College London which uses deep learning to detect and localise
vertebrae centroids from CT scans.
(dataset: https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/data/spine/)

A paper was subsequently written explaining my results and was accepted into
the MICCAI 2019 conference in the MSKI workshop.

The purpose of this repository is so that other researchers can reproduce the
results.

This repository is currently going through a clean up phase to make it easier
for others to use but that process will be finished by the 17th October when
the MSKI workshop takes place.
